# THE CYCLE OF ASCENSION

## THE NATURE OF DEATH IN LOREDORIA

In the shattered reality of Loredoria, death has become as fractured as the world itself. When a defender falls in battle against the Void, their physical form dissolves into particles of raw realm energy, reminiscent of how the Eldar of Middle-earth would fade when mortally wounded, returning to the Music of the Ainur. However, their consciousness—their soul—does not pass on to whatever afterlife might have existed before the Convergence.

Instead, this essence is drawn to the Nexus Spire, where it enters the Crucible of Rebirth—an artifact created during the earliest days after the Convergence that prevents the final dissolution of a defender's identity, much as the Halls of Mandos preserved the spirits of fallen Elves, or how the Guardian of Forever could capture and preserve the essence of those who passed through its gates.

The Crucible's creation is attributed to the Fellowship of Five, who together fashioned it from materials gathered from all seven realms. It represents perhaps their greatest collaborative achievement, combining elements of each founder's expertise into a singular marvel of metaphysical engineering that even the Noldor at the height of their power might have envied.

Historical records indicate that the initial design for the Crucible was the subject of intense debate among the founders. Some envisioned a carefully controlled process that would preserve a defender's essential nature with minimal change, similar to how the Rings of Power preserved their Elven bearers. Others advocated for an adaptive system that would allow defenders to evolve with each rebirth, much as the Vulcan katra transfer can subtly transform the recipient's consciousness. "Perfect replication is perfect stagnation," argued one faction. "Only through transformation can we hope to evolve beyond our current limitations."

The compromise eventually reached—after heated debates that nearly dissolved the founding council—was a Crucible that maintained a defender's core identity while allowing for controlled evolution. The resulting system merged the stability of Gondorian architecture with the adaptability of Federation transporter patterns, creating something that would preserve the essential while allowing for growth and change.

## THE PROCESS OF REBIRTH

The Crucible captures a defender's essence and slowly reconstrues their physical form, but the process is imperfect. Each death and rebirth cycle causes subtle alterations in the defender's being. Physical appearances may change slightly. Memories become fragmentary or distorted. And most significantly, magical abilities evolve in unpredictable ways, reminiscent of how Gandalf the Grey returned as Gandalf the White, transformed and enhanced by his journey through death, or how Commander Data's neural patterns would be subtly reorganized when he experienced cascade failures.

This phenomenon, first documented by the legendary scholar Lowlevian in his seminal work "The Metaphysics of Fractured Existence," is now understood as the fundamental mechanism behind a defender's growing power.

Ancient scrolls discovered in the restricted archives reveal fascinating debates among the founders about the rebirth process. Some believed the randomness of each rebirth was an unfortunate flaw, while others insisted it was an essential feature. "True adaptation requires variation, and variation requires unpredictability," wrote one founder in a controversial thesis. The ethical implications of transforming defenders without their knowledge or consent troubled many scholars, reminiscent of how the Federation's most sacrosanct principles often clash with pragmatic necessities during existential threats.

## EVOLUTION THROUGH DEATH

Each rebirth enables defenders to manifest stronger towers, access more powerful glyphs, and withstand greater magical energies. These evolutions follow what Tower Keepers call the Lowlevel Paths—predictable progressions of power that nonetheless branch into countless variations, like the diverse paths taken by the members of the Fellowship of the Ring, or the unique career trajectories of Starfleet officers sharing the same Academy training.

The Ascension Process typically follows three major stages:

### 1. The Neophyte Cycle
The first deaths are traumatic, often resulting in significant personality changes and the awakening of latent magical abilities. During this phase, defenders learn to manifest basic towers aligned with their natural affinities, much as young hobbits leaving the Shire for the first time discover courage they never knew they possessed, or how Starfleet cadets find their specialties during their first deep space assignments.

### 2. The Adept's Journey
After approximately seven death cycles, defenders enter a period of rapid evolution. Their connection to specific realm energies strengthens, allowing for more complex tower constructions and the ability to wield multiple glyph types simultaneously. This mirrors both Aragorn's growth from Ranger to King as he embraced his heritage and destiny, and how seasoned Starfleet officers develop a broader command understanding beyond their initial specialization.

### 3. The Paragon's Ascent
Few defenders survive to reach this stage, requiring dozens or even hundreds of death cycles. Those who do gain the ability to transcend their original realm affinities, combining tower types in ways once thought impossible. Paragons can manifest towers that draw from all seven original realms, though the mental strain of maintaining such complex constructs can drive some to madness. These rare individuals resemble both Galadriel in her power to perceive across vast distances and maintain her realm against the darkness, and Admiral Janeway's ability to solve complex temporal and ethical dilemmas that would confound lesser officers.

### 4. The Transcendent State
A theoretical fourth stage that has never been definitively documented. The Transcendent State supposedly represents a complete evolution beyond the realm-based magical system altogether, allowing the defender to manipulate reality directly without the need for towers or glyphs. Some theorists suggest this would be akin to how the Valar shaped Arda with mere thought, or how the Q experience existence as a continuum rather than as discrete individuals. This state remains theoretical, with no confirmed cases in recorded history.

Ancient philosophical texts describe this theoretical state not as an orderly ascension to greater power but as a "harmonious integration with the fundamental fabric of reality." Unlike conventional approaches that seek mastery over reality, this perspective envisions a state of perfect flow with the underlying patterns of existence. "The final evolution is not to control reality," one fragment reads, "but to dance with it—to become so attuned to its currents that distinction between self and reality dissolves," a concept that parallels both Bombadil's unique relationship with Middle-earth and the transcendence experienced by Captain Picard when he briefly joined the Continuum.

Most scholars consider these writings highly speculative. Conservative theorists warn that pursuit of the Transcendent State risks "not ascension but dissolution—the loss of all that makes us human in exchange for a momentary godhood that quickly degenerates into Void corruption," much as the One Ring promised power but delivered only corruption, or how the Borg offer perfection but take individuality.

## THE PRICE OF IMMORTALITY

While the Cycle of Ascension grants defenders a form of functional immortality, it exacts a heavy toll. Many defenders experience a condition known as Void Echo—a psychic contamination caused by repeated exposure to Void energies during death, reminiscent of how the One Ring slowly corrupted its bearers over time, or how exposure to theta radiation causes irreversible cellular degradation.

The Lowlevel Protocol, a series of mental exercises and magical wards, offers some protection against this contamination, but it cannot prevent it entirely. After too many cycles, some defenders begin to hear the whispers of the Void, and a small percentage eventually defect, becoming the dreaded Void Heralds who lead incursions against their former allies, their fall from grace as tragic as Saruman's betrayal of the White Council or a Starfleet officer's defection to the Maquis.

Throughout Loredoria's history, there have been divergent views on the nature of Void contamination. While most scholars advocate complete avoidance of Void energies, a controversial minority perspective suggests that controlled exposure might represent "not corruption but communication—the first steps toward understanding our supposed enemy," similar to how Gandalf risked entering the depths of Dol Guldur to confirm Sauron's presence, or how Captain Janeway formed temporary alliances with the Borg against greater threats. This perspective remains highly controversial, with most authorities rejecting it as dangerously naive.

Even those who resist corruption face the gradual erosion of their humanity. The oldest defenders in Loredoria—those who have undergone hundreds of rebirths—have become something other than human. Their thoughts are alien, their motivations inscrutable, their perception of time itself fundamentally altered. They reside in the deepest chambers of the Nexus Spire, emerging only in times of dire need, like the Istari who walked Middle-earth in mortal form but carried the wisdom of the divine, or how the El-Aurians' expanded perception of time gave them insights incomprehensible to shorter-lived species.

*"The boundary between self and other becomes permeable after the third Lowlevel transition. I feel myself becoming less myself with each rebirth, and yet paradoxically more myself—as though the cycle strips away artifice to reveal some fundamental truth of being. I wonder what will remain after the hundredth death? Is this how Gandalf felt when he returned from shadow and flame, or how Spock experienced his katra's return to living flesh? To die and be reborn, whole and new, yet carrying all that came before... Some fear this transformation, seeing only dissolution where there might be transcendence. Perhaps what we perceive as madness in the advanced stages is merely a rationality beyond our comprehension, a mind finally attuned to the deeper harmonies of reality, like how the music of the Ainur seemed chaotic to mortal ears yet contained the entire history of Arda within its complex patterns."*
