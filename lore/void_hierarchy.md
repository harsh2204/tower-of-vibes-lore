# THE VOID HIERARCHY

## THE NATURE OF THE VOID

The Void is not merely emptiness—it is an active, consuming force that exists in direct opposition to the ordered reality of the seven realms, reminiscent of both the consuming darkness that dwelled in Moria and the negative space of the Bajoran wormhole inverted. While scholars debate whether the Void is truly sentient, all agree that it exhibits a disturbing purposefulness in its actions, much like the malevolence that guided Sauron's forces or the collective consciousness that drives the Borg.

The ancient Primordial Codex describes the Void as "the hungering absence that lies between realities," suggesting it may be the very medium through which the seven realms once existed as separate entities, similar to the Great Void between stars that Earendil navigated in his enchanted ship. When the Convergence shattered the boundaries between worlds, it created wounds in reality through which the Void now seeps, like subspace tears in the fabric of spacetime.

Among the most controversial theories about the Void comes from ancient scrolls discovered in the deepest archives, which suggest the Void is not an external force but rather the shadow of creation itself—an inevitable byproduct of existence. While most scholars viewed the Void with horror and revulsion, these ancient writings approach it with fascination and even a certain reverence. "The Void is not our enemy," one passage reads, "but our complement—the necessary chaos that balances our order, the darkness that defines our light," a philosophy reminiscent of both the Elven understanding of the Music of the Ainur containing both harmony and discord, and the Vulcan concept of complementary opposites necessary for universal balance.

This perspective caused deep rifts among early scholars. Some condemned such views as "dangerous romanticism," while others dismissed them as "the musings of minds too enamored with disorder to recognize true threat." If these ancient theories are correct, however, the Void cannot be defeated, only balanced against the forces of order and creation—a position that remains deeply unpopular among most defenders but resonates with both Gandalf's warnings about the limitations of power and Captain Janeway's reflections on the necessity of understanding one's enemies.

## THE VOIDSPAWN TAXONOMY

The creatures that emerge from Void Rifts—collectively known as Voidspawn—follow a complex hierarchical structure documented extensively in the Teej Classification System. This system, developed by early defenders who noticed patterns in Void incursion forces, has proven remarkably accurate in predicting enemy capabilities and behaviors, much as the White Council cataloged the servants of the Enemy or how Starfleet categorizes new species by behavior patterns and threat assessment.

Alternative classification approaches have been proposed over the centuries. Some defenders and scholars prefer to describe Voidspawn not by type but by behavior patterns, energy signatures, and adaptive capabilities. "Each Voidspawn is unique," notes one controversial treatise, "just as each defender is unique. Their perceived sameness is an illusion born of our need to impose order on chaos," a perspective that echoes both Gandalf's insistence that each servant of darkness had its own nature and motivations, and the Federation's principle that even hostile species must be understood on their own terms.

### THE LOWLEVEL MASSES

**Void Motes** - The simplest form of Voidspawn, these tiny particles of animate darkness swarm in massive numbers, reminiscent of the ash clouds of Mordor. Individually harmless, their strength lies in overwhelming quantity, much like the nanoprobes that comprise the first wave of any Borg assimilation attempt.

**Void Drones** - Basic foot soldiers of the Void, these humanoid-shaped entities possess limited intelligence but unwavering aggression. They appear in endless waves during incursions, their mindless determination similar to both the lesser Orcs of Mordor and the drone units of a Borg Collective.

**Void Stalkers** - Swift, predatory entities that specialize in targeting isolated defenders or outlying towers. They can temporarily phase out of reality to avoid attacks, their ability to shift between worlds reminiscent of the Ringwraiths when they entered the shadow realm, or Romulan vessels when they activate their cloaking devices.

**Void Brutes** - Massive, resilient entities that absorb tremendous damage while slowly advancing toward defensive positions. They often serve as shields for more vulnerable Voidspawn, their hulking forms and incredible endurance calling to mind both the Cave Trolls of Moria and the Jem'Hadar shock troops bred for battle.

### THE MADISON SPECIALIZATIONS

**Void Sappers** - Technical specialists that attack tower foundations with corrosive energies. Named after the Madisonian principle they violate, these entities specifically target the harmonic frequencies that maintain tower stability, much as Gríma Wormtongue undermined the structural integrity of Théoden's kingdom from within, or how a computer virus might target the core programming of a starship's defense systems.

**Void Weavers** - Entities that manipulate reality around them, creating local distortions that can render towers ineffective or redirect their attacks. They employ counter-harmonics to the Madisonian resonance patterns used in defensive structures, their reality-bending powers reminiscent of both Saruman's voice when he cast enchantments and the reality-warping capabilities of the Q Continuum.

**Void Harvesters** - These entities don't attack directly but instead absorb realm energy from the environment, creating dead zones where towers cannot be constructed. They are particularly drawn to Convergence Zones rich in untapped energy, their draining presence similar to how the Nazgûl created regions of cold despair around them, or how certain quantum singularities in the Delta Quadrant absorbed all forms of energy in their vicinity.

### THE TEEJANIC ELITES

**Void Heralds** - Former defenders who have succumbed to Void corruption and now lead incursion forces with tactical brilliance. They retain knowledge of defensive strategies and can counter specific tower arrangements, much as Saruman turned his vast knowledge against the forces of good, or how Borg tactical drones assimilate and then exploit Federation battle strategies. Many still carry corrupted versions of their original glyph decks, twisted by Teejanic inversion principles.

**Void Colossi** - Enormous entities that serve as living siege weapons, as terrifying as the Mûmakil that the Haradrim brought to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Each Colossus is unique, possessing specialized abilities to counter specific defensive strategies. Their internal structures mimic perverted versions of Teejanic artifice, much as the Borg adapt Federation technology for their own destructive purposes.

**Void Adepts** - Specialist entities that can temporarily nullify or corrupt glyphs, turning towers against their creators. They understand and exploit the fundamental weaknesses in the Teejanic Method of glyph binding, their ability to subvert magical defenses reminiscent of how the Witch-king of Angmar could break any blade, or how certain hyperintelligent species like the Bynars can reprogram even the most secure computer systems.

### THE PRIME SOVEREIGNTY

**Void Monarchs** - Commanders of large-scale incursions who coordinate the actions of lesser Voidspawn with disturbing intelligence, reminiscent of how Sauron's lieutenants directed the armies of Mordor. Each Monarch possesses unique abilities and tactics, often specializing in countering specific House defenses. They communicate through a telepathic network known as the Prime Void Lattice, similar to the Borg Collective's hive mind but with more individualized strategic thinking.

**Void Archons** - Seven unique entities, each embodying the corrupted essence of one of the original realms. The Archons are rarely seen, emerging only during the most significant incursions, their arrival as portentous as that of the Balrog in Moria or the emergence of the Borg Queen during a critical assimilation effort. Each possesses powers that mirror and corrupt those of its corresponding Great House. They are believed to form the Prime Void Council that directs all Void activities, their gathering as rare and terrible as a meeting of Sauron with all nine Ringwraiths.

**The Nameless** - A theoretical entity that defenders speak of only in whispers, like the dread name of Morgoth in the darkest days of Middle-earth. If the Void Hierarchy truly does mirror the structure of Loredoria's defenders, then logic suggests there must be a singular intelligence directing the Archons—a Void equivalent of the Nexus Spire itself. No defender has ever encountered this entity and survived to report it, but certain patterns in large-scale Void behavior suggest a guiding intelligence beyond even the Archons, much as Captain Picard sensed a greater intelligence behind the actions of the Crystalline Entity.

### THE COSMIC ANTITHESIS

**The Unmaking** - A hypothetical entity mentioned only in the most restricted texts of the Archives, its relationship to existence similar to how Ungoliant sought to devour all light, or how the V'ger entity threatened to absorb and catalog all consciousness. According to these sources, the Unmaking represents the entropy that seeks to unravel all that is. Some defenders who have experienced hundreds of death cycles claim to have glimpsed this entity during their moments between dissolution and rebirth—a presence of such absolute negation that it cannot be described in terms of form or consciousness, only as the perfect absence of everything that is, reminiscent of both the Timeless Void beyond Arda and the theoretical state of absolute null space outside our universe's boundaries.

Ancient texts found in the deepest archives take a surprisingly philosophical approach when discussing the Unmaking. While most traditional texts express only fear and rejection of this theoretical entity, these rare scrolls describe it as "the necessary counterbalance," "the completion of the cycle," and even "the twin and reflection of all creation." One passage asserts that "where creation sows order from chaos, the Unmaking harvests chaos from order—they are two sides of the same coin," a concept that parallels both the Elven understanding of the world's beginning and ending, and the Federation's growing comprehension of matter and antimatter as complementary rather than opposing forces.

Most disturbing to orthodox defenders is the suggestion in these texts that "to truly understand the Unmaking is to understand creation itself, and to understand both is to transcend the false dichotomy between creation and destruction." This concept forms the core of what would later become the controversial Integration philosophy that seeks harmony rather than victory.

These forbidden writings warn that the Unmaking is not merely a powerful Voidspawn but the very source of the Void itself. If this is true, then the war between Loredoria and the Void may be merely the surface manifestation of a deeper cosmic struggle between beginning and ending, creation and dissolution, being and non-being—a struggle not unlike the Music of the Ainur that contained both Ilúvatar's themes and Melkor's discordant notes, or the theoretical omega point that some Federation physicists believe represents the universe's final state.

## VOID CORRUPTION

The most insidious aspect of the Void is its ability to corrupt living beings and even the fabric of reality itself. This corruption progresses through stages documented in the Lowlevel Progression, its gradual power reminiscent of both the slow corruption of the One Ring and the methodical process of Borg assimilation:

1. **Exposure** - Initial contact with Void energy causes physical discomfort and minor hallucinations, similar to how Frodo first sensed the approach of the Ringwraiths, or how crew members first experience the disorientation of a subspace anomaly.

2. **Infiltration** - Void particles enter the bloodstream or energy matrix, causing visible physical changes and personality shifts, much like the early effects of the Ring on Bilbo, or the first visible signs of Borg nanoprobe circulation.

3. **Conversion** - The subject begins to hear the Void's whispers and may consciously choose to serve it, reminiscent of how Saruman was swayed by the voice of Sauron, or how assimilated drones begin to hear the Collective.

4. **Transformation** - Physical form partially dissolves and reforms with Void characteristics, a process that echoes the transformation of Gollum from hobbit to creature, or the physical reconfiguration during full Borg assimilation.

5. **Transcendence** - Complete integration with the Void Hierarchy, resulting in a new Voidspawn entity, much as the Nazgûl were once kings of Men before becoming wraiths, or how a fully assimilated drone loses all individuality to become part of the greater Collective.

Sealed in the most restricted section of the Archives are ancient records describing voluntary experiments with the early stages of Void exposure. While most scholars advocated complete avoidance of Void energies, these controversial texts suggest that controlled exposure could lead to greater understanding and even beneficial adaptations. "That which does not fully corrupt us makes us stronger," one passage declares. "Fear of the Void limits our growth more than the Void itself," a philosophy that parallels both Gandalf's caution that "not all darkness is evil" and Captain Janeway's controversial decision to forge alliances with certain Borg factions against greater threats.

There exist unverified rumors of rare individuals throughout history who achieved a state of partial Void integration without succumbing to corruption—a perfect balance between order and chaos, creation and destruction, reminiscent of how Gandalf returned from death transformed yet uncorrupted, or how Captain Picard retained elements of his experience as Locutus while returning to his humanity. If true, these legends would explain certain mysterious figures occasionally glimpsed at the boundaries between reality and Void, neither fully human nor fully Voidspawn, but something transcendent of both.

*"I have studied the enemy for decades, and one disturbing truth emerges: the Void Hierarchy mirrors our own. For every tower we build, they evolve a counter. For every strategy we develop, they adapt. The Prime Sovereignty, the Teejanic Elites, the Madison Specializations, the Lowlevel Masses, and the Cosmic Antithesis—they are dark reflections of our own structures, much as Sauron was once a Maia like Gandalf, or how the Borg represent the dark mirror of Federation technology. Perhaps what we consider a mockery of our perfect order is not distorted but clarified, showing us what we refuse to see in ourselves. As Galadriel warned the Fellowship when she was tempted by the Ring, 'Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen, not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!' We too must guard against becoming what we fight. If we are to survive, we must first understand: what do they see when they look at us?"*
