# THE SEVEN GREAT HOUSES

## THE FOUNDING OF THE HOUSES

Before the Convergence, the seven realms were home to distinct civilizations with their own cultures, technologies, and magics, much like the diverse kingdoms of Middle-earth or the varied member worlds of the Federation. When these worlds collided, most of their populations perished in the resulting chaos.

Those who survived gravitated toward others from their home realms, forming enclaves based on shared heritage and compatible magical abilities, reminiscent of how the scattered Elven peoples formed Rivendell, Lothlorien, and other havens after the breaking of Beleriand. These enclaves eventually formalized into the Great Houses—political and magical organizations dedicated to preserving what remained of their ancestral knowledge.

The Council of Five recognized that the preservation of each realm's unique character was essential to maintaining the stability of Loredoria, similar to how the Federation values the distinct cultures of its member worlds. Through their collective wisdom and diplomacy, the initial conflicts between realm survivors were calmed, allowing for the establishment of a tentative peace, much as Aragorn's coronation united the fractured kingdoms of Men.

The Teejanic Accords, signed in the early years after the establishment of the Nexus Spire, formalized the relationships between these Houses and established their shared responsibility for Loredoria's defense, not unlike the Treaty of Organia that established peaceful relations between the Federation and the Klingon Empire despite their differences.

## THE HOUSE HIERARCHY

Each House maintains its own internal hierarchy, typically led by a Council of Elders or a singular Archon, similar to how each realm of Middle-earth had its own governance structure—from the Stewards of Gondor to the Kings Under the Mountain. House members are trained from childhood in their realm's particular magical disciplines, with the most talented rising to become Tower Keepers—elite mages who can directly interface with and control defensive towers, their training as rigorous as that of Starfleet officers at the Academy.

While rivalry between Houses is fierce, the threat of the Void necessitates cooperation. The Teej Conclave, a monthly gathering of House representatives named after the neutral ground where it takes place, serves as a forum for resolving disputes and coordinating defensive strategies. These meetings echo both the Council of Elrond, where representatives of Middle-earth's free peoples gathered to determine the fate of the One Ring, and Federation Council sessions where diverse worlds find common ground despite their differences.

Some House archives secretly maintain ancient harmonization ceremonies—rituals that supposedly date back to the earliest days after the Convergence. These ceremonies often involve techniques for balancing energies across multiple realms, something most Tower Keepers find nearly impossible to achieve without decades of study, much like how Gandalf alone among the Istari mastered both subtle magics and powerful confrontation, or how Vulcan adepts require years to master both logic and the volatile katra energies.

## THE SEVEN HOUSES AND THEIR TOWERS

### House Ignis
**Origin Realm**: The Ashen Expanse  
**Tower Specialties**: Area damage, burn effects, explosive force  
**Notable Towers**: Inferno Spire, Magma Cannon, Emberweave Lattice

Masters of flame and fury, their crimson towers rain devastation upon enemies like the fires of Mount Doom. Their Pyromancer Towers channel the molten core of the Ashen Realm, a world consumed by eternal volcanoes reminiscent of Mordor's blasted landscapes. House Ignis follows the Credo of Cleansing Flame, believing that destruction is often necessary for renewal, a philosophy that mirrors both the Klingon belief in honorable combat and the cleansing fires that sometimes renew forest ecosystems.

### House Sylvan
**Origin Realm**: The Verdant Expanse  
**Tower Specialties**: Crowd control, poison damage, battlefield manipulation  
**Notable Towers**: Thornwreath Spire, Spore Cloud Generator, Living Barricade

Guardians of nature's wrath, with powers reminiscent of both the Ents of Fangorn Forest and the plant manipulation abilities of Betazoid botanical scientists. Their living towers ensnare and poison invaders with sentient vines and toxic spores harvested from the remnants of the Verdant Expanse. The Sylvan Conclave practices the Way of Adaptive Growth, constantly evolving their defenses to match new threats, much as the Elves adapted their forestry to maintain balance over thousands of years.

### House Arcanum
**Origin Realm**: The Astral Dominion  
**Tower Specialties**: Energy manipulation, debuffs, reality distortion  
**Notable Towers**: Chronoshift Engine, Manaweave Matrix, Starfall Conduit

Wielders of raw arcane energy that would make even Gandalf the White take notice. Their crystalline towers manipulate time and space, drawing power from the shattered remains of the Astral Dominion. Arcanum scholars study the Teej Equations—fundamental principles of reality manipulation reminiscent of both the ancient Elvish arts and the theoretical subspace mechanics researched at the Vulcan Science Academy.

### House Ferrox
**Origin Realm**: The Iron Collective  
**Tower Specialties**: Single-target damage, mechanical effects, technological synergies  
**Notable Towers**: Ballistic Annihilator, Shellstorm Array, Kinetic Disruptor

Engineers of destruction whose technological prowess rivals that of the Engineers of Khazad-dûm in their prime. Their mechanical towers deploy devastating weaponry forged in the fallen techno-metropolis of the Iron Collective. House Ferrox maintains the largest repository of pre-Convergence technology, carefully reconstructing and enhancing the machines of their lost world, their workshops buzzing with activity reminiscent of both the forges of Erebor and Starfleet's Advanced Tactical Unit.

### House Umbra
**Origin Realm**: The Abyss  
**Tower Specialties**: Fear effects, shadow manipulation, mind control  
**Notable Towers**: Nightmare Obelisk, Void Siphon, Whispering Spire

Masters of shadow and deceit who understand darkness as intimately as the Nazgûl once did. Their obsidian towers corrupt and terrify, channeling the nightmares that once ruled the now-fractured Abyss. The secretive Umbral Cabal is rumored to communicate directly with certain Void entities, walking a dangerous line between understanding their enemy and being consumed by it, much as Saruman walked between serving the White Council and his own ambition, or how Section 31 operates in the grey areas of Federation ethics.

### House Lumina
**Origin Realm**: The Celestial Sanctum  
**Tower Specialties**: Support, healing, protective barriers  
**Notable Towers**: Radiant Beacon, Sanctuary Pylon, Dawn's Bastion

Bearers of divine light, their radiance reminiscent of both Galadriel's phial and the crystalline-based healing technologies of the Denobulans. Their radiant towers smite evil and bolster allies, preserving the last embers of the Celestial Sanctum. The Order of Illumination, House Lumina's governing body, adheres strictly to the Teejanic Principles of Purity in their tower designs, believing that contamination with other magics weakens their effectiveness, much as the High Elves maintained their ancient arts separate from the adaptations of their woodland kin.

### House Vortex
**Origin Realm**: The Maelstrom Realm  
**Tower Specialties**: Area control, elemental damage, chain effects  
**Notable Towers**: Tempest Conduit, Tsunami Generator, Stormheart Spire

Commanders of storms and sea who would make Ulmo, Lord of Waters, proud. Their tempest towers control the battlefield with elemental fury, harnessing the chaotic energies of the Maelstrom Realm. House Vortex embraces chaos through their philosophy of Controlled Turbulence, believing that only through understanding disorder can one truly master it, a philosophy that echoes both Gandalf's recognition that "even the very wise cannot see all ends" and the Starfleet principle of adaptive response to the unexpected.

## THE LEGEND OF THE FELLOWSHIP

Whispers persist of a select few individuals throughout history who have achieved what the original Fellowship of Five only glimpsed—the ability to channel the energies of all seven realms simultaneously. Most dismiss these tales as mere legend, but occasionally, Tower Keepers report encountering mysterious defenders who manifest towers with properties from multiple Houses with impossible ease.

These rare individuals, if they truly exist, are said to embody the complete harmony of all realms' powers, much as Gandalf the White returned with greater power that transcended his previous limitations, or how Jean-Luc Picard briefly experienced existence as part of the Q continuum. According to the legend, these enlightened few understand a deeper truth about Loredoria—that the seven realms were once a single reality before some ancient cataclysm shattered it into fragments long before the Convergence.

*"The Seven Houses squabble like children over toys while the realm burns around them. Only through the wisdom of the Teej Principles have we managed any semblance of unity. I sometimes wonder if the Void is not our true enemy, but merely a reflection of our own divided nature. As Galadriel once said to the Fellowship, 'Your quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail.' So too does our union of Houses balance precariously—and yet, in our diversity lies our greatest strength, if only we could see it as Captain Kirk once observed of the original Enterprise crew: 'We are stronger together than we could ever be apart.'"*  
— From the private journals of Hierophant Amara, House Lumina
